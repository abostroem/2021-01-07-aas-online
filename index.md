{% endcomment %}
The astronomy-tailored curriculum is designed to provide astronomers with essential skills for data-intensive
analysis and visualization. The curriculum focuses on building complex SQL queries using Astroquery, working with the retrieved data
in Astropy Tables and Pandas DataFrames, storing the data locally for future use, and communicating the results with clear and compelling figures using Matplotlib.

This workshop is intended for folks in the Astronomy community at all stages of their education and careers. Participants are expected to have knowledge equivalent to the Software Carpentry Python Curriculum: the ability to write a function in Python, familiarity with Python built-in types such as lists and dictionaries, and the ability to navigate directories using the command line. In addition, we welcome participants who are familiar with the concepts presented and would like to provide comprehensive feedback on the lessons.

### Jupyter Notebook

For this workshop, we encourage you to work in a Jupyter notebook.
If you are not familiar with Jupyter, you can [run a tutorial by clicking here](https://jupyter.org/try).
Then select "Try Classic Notebook".  It will open a notebook with instructions for getting started.

You will need to install Python, Jupyter, and some additional libraries.
If you don't already have Jupyter, we recommend installing Anaconda, which is a Python distribution that 
contains everything you need to run the workshop code.  It is easy to install on Windows, Mac, and Linux, 
and because it does a user-level install, it will not interfere with other Python installations.

[Information about installing Anaconda is here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

If you have the choice of Python 2 or 3, choose Python 3.

There are two ways to get the libraries you need:
* You can create a new Conda environment (recommended).
* You can install them in an existing Conda environment (not recommended).

Installing libraries in an existing environment is simpler, but if you use the same environment for many projects, it will get big, complicated, and prone to package conflicts.

It is also possible to install the libraries you need using `pip`, but we don't recommend it.

#### Create a new Conda environment

To create a new Conda environment, you'll need to download an environment file from our repository.  On Mac or Linux, you can download it using `wget` on the command line: 

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenDowney/AstronomicalData/main/environment.yml
```

Or you can [download it using this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenDowney/AstronomicalData/main/environment.yml); make sure the filename is `environment.yml`, not `environment.yml.txt`.

In a Terminal or Jupyter Prompt, make sure you are in folder where `environment.yml` is stored, and run:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then, to activate the environment you just created, run:

```
conda activate AstronomicalData
```

#### Install libraries in an existing Conda environment (not recommended)

The libraries we need can be installed using Conda, by running the following commands in a Terminal.
If you are on a Mac or Linux machine, you should be able to use any Terminal.  If you are on Windows, you might have to use the Anaconda Prompt, which you can find under the Start menu.

```
conda config --append channels conda-forge
conda install jupyter numpy scipy pandas matplotlib seaborn libopenblas
conda install -c conda-forge astropy astroquery gala python-wget
```

If you are on Windows, you might have to install gala with pip, like this:

```
pip install gala
```

#### Run Jupyter

Before you launch Jupyter, [download this notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenDowney/AstronomicalData/main/test_setup.ipynb), which contains code to test your environment.

Or you can use `wget` to download it on the command line, like this:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenDowney/AstronomicalData/main/test_setup.ipynb
```

To start Jupyter, make sure the right Conda environment is activated, then run:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter should launch your default browser or open a tab in an existing browser window.
If not, the Jupyter server should print a URL you can use.  For example, when I launch Jupyter, I get

```
$ jupyter notebook
[I 10:03:20.115 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/username
[I 10:03:20.115 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
[I 10:03:20.115 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/
[I 10:03:20.115 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
```

In this example, the URL is [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).  
When you start your server, you might get a different URL.
Whatever it is, if you paste it into a browser, you should should see a home page with a list of directories.

Now open the notebook you downloaded, `test_setup.ipynb`, and run the cells that contain `import` statements.
If they work and you get no error messages, **you are all set**.

If you get error messages about missing packages, you can install the packages you need using Conda or `pip`.

At the end of the notebook, you'll be asked to copy and paste a line of code from [our Slack workspace](https://app.slack.com/client/T01DJHEP8Q1/C01D2TZA8SH)
to the Jupyter notebook and run it.
The reason for this test is that some environments convert "straight" quotation marks to "smart" quotation
marks, which breaks Python code.
If you encounter this problem, you might have to check your system settings to turn off this "feature".

If you run into problems with these instructions, let us know and we will make corrections.  Good luck!
